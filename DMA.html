                        The aim of the course is to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of
                        algorithmic thinking, allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to real-world
                        computational problems by building on the principles of mathematics.

                        The course will enable the student to apply a wide range of existing algorithms and data
                        structures for fundamental problems, as well as general methods for developing new
                        algorithms and mathematical tools for analyzing the correctness and efficiency of
                        algorithms. This is of paramount importance for the ability to develop efficient software,
                        and is central to the understanding of upper and lower bounds for computational problems.

                        In relation to the competence profile of the Software Technology programme it is the
                        explicit focus of the course to:
